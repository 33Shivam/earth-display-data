Title: Repository for Testing 3D Map Module

Description: This repository is dedicated to testing a 3D map module. The primary goal of this module is to obtain a large amount of data and display it on a map based on specified coordinates.

In essence, it appears to be a software project or code repository where developers are working on a 3D mapping module that can handle bulk data and visualize it on a map using given geographical coordinates. This kind of technology could be used for various applications, such as geographical data analysis, geospatial visualization, or location-based services.
