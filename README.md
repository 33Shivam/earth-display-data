# 3D Map Module using Three.js

This is a 3D map module built with Three.js. It allows you to create interactive 3D maps for your web applications. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-3d-map-module.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-3d-map-module
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Include the Three.js library in your HTML file:

   ```html
   <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js"></script>
   ```

2. Include your 3D map module script:

   ```html
   <script src="path-to-your-3d-map-module.js"></script>
   ```

3. Create an HTML container element where you want to display the 3D map:

   ```html
   <div id="map-container"></div>
   ```

4. Initialize the 3D map module in your JavaScript code:

   ```javascript
   const mapContainer = document.getElementById('map-container');
   const mapModule = new MapModule(mapContainer, options);
   ```

   Replace `MapModule` with the actual class or object you use for your 3D map module, and `options` with any configuration options you support.

5. Customize your map by adding markers, terrain, textures, and other elements as required.

6. Add event listeners or user interactions as needed for your application.

## Configuration

You can configure the 3D map module by providing options when initializing it. Refer to the documentation or code comments for available configuration options.

```javascript
const options = {
  // Add your configuration options here
};
```
