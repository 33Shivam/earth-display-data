I'm unable to directly access external websites or resources like GitHub in real-time due to my knowledge limitations and capabilities. However, I can guide you on how to access the README file for the repository "earth-display-data" on GitHub.

To read the README file for the GitHub repository, follow these steps:

1. Open your web browser.

2. Go to the GitHub repository URL: [https://github.com/33Shivam/earth-display-data](https://github.com/33Shivam/earth-display-data).

3. On the repository's main page, look for the "Code" button. It's usually located near the top of the page, on the right side.

4. Click on the "Code" button, and a drop-down menu will appear.

5. In the drop-down menu, you will see an option to "View README." Click on it.

6. This will take you to the README file of the repository, where you can read the information and documentation provided by the repository owner.

The README file is often used to provide an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and other important information. You can browse and read the contents of the README file directly in your web browser.

Keep in mind that the availability and content of the README file may vary depending on the repository and the preferences of the repository owner.
